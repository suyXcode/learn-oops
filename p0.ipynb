    "# OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🌟 What is OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects — entities that contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "- It helps make code modular, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧱 Class :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "- It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the object’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Think of a class like a “Car design” — not an actual car, just the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚗 Object :**\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class — a real-world entity created using the class.\n",
    "Each object has its own data (attributes) and can call the methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Think of an object like an actual “Car” made from the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔑 4 Main Pillars of OOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣ Encapsulation — Data Hiding**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).\n",
    "It also restricts direct access to some variables — this is known as data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣ Inheritance — Code Reusability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent).\n",
    "It promotes code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣ Polymorphism — Many Forms**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition:\n",
    "- \n",
    "Polymorphism means many forms — the same function name can be used for different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Function Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣ Abstraction — Hiding Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and methods (from the abc module).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹 2️⃣ Class Members and Object Members\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔸 Class Members (Class Variables)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
    "- Declared inside the class but outside methods.\n",
    "- Accessed using ClassName.variable_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔸 Object Members (Instance Variables)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Belong to each individual object.\n",
    "- Created inside the constructor (__init__) or methods using self.\n",
    "- Accessed with object_name.variable_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ⚙️ 3️⃣ Types of Methods in a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧠 (i) Instance Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operates on instance variables.\n",
    "- First parameter is always self.\n",
    "- Accessed by using object name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏫 (ii) Class Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works with class variables.\n",
    "- Decorated with @classmethod.\n",
    "- Takes cls (class reference) as the first argument.\n",
    "- Accessed by class name or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧰 (iii) Static Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not depend on instance or class variables.\n",
    "- Defined using @staticmethod.\n",
    "- Can be used for utility work."
